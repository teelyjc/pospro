# Point Of Sales System - written in PHP üêò

`This project is currently in active development.`

 This project was assigned by Dr.Paisan as a Term Project on the subject of Internet Programming.

I did not have any idea about my app. So I implement the Pos system for my project.

## Requirements
- Use MySQL or SQL likes
- Make some columns at least 5
- Can read, write, update, and delete all columns
- Every file must be meaningful to determine what functions the file performs
- Every table should have 10 records for each table
- Should have multipart for uploading an image or document of at least 2 parts
- Should have an authentication such as Login or Signin and permission for limited scope for each user
- Security such as hidden type input, sessions, encrypt data at URL

## Concept
I want to implement this project in the Clean Architecture for easier to maintain this system.

## Installation

`If you are not using Dev Container. You can manually run it on your way`

You must install `docker` on your computer and `Dev Container` A vs code extension.

After the above, you can clone this project and open it with vs code. 
You can manually start the PHP Development server by opening your terminal and executing `php -S <host:port>` to start it.
